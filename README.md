## üìÅ Projects

### [MoviesDB ‚Äì SQL Database Project](https://github.com/Mkrela11/Workspace/blob/main/MoviesDB)

A comprehensive SQL database project built entirely from scratch, focusing on:

- Designing normalized tables with constraints and foreign key relations  
- Populating data from real-world Oscar-winning films and actors  
- Implementing analytical SQL queries and custom views  
- Performing data cleaning and validation using `ALTER`, `MERGE`, `CHECK`, and `PIVOT`  
- Incorporating sentiment analysis of reviews via keyword classification  

This project demonstrates both technical SQL skills and a thoughtful approach to relational database design and storytelling through data.

### [Job Listing Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Application Portal (Simulation)](https://github.com/Mkrela11/Workspace/blob/main/Job%20Application%20Dashboard.pbix)

An interactive Power BI dashboard simulating a **job application portal**, built to showcase user experience design and analytical capabilities. The dashboard allows users to:

-  Browse job offers filtered by **location**, **department**, and **work model** (remote / hybrid / on-site)  
-  Explore visual summaries of job openings across Europe via **map and bar charts**  
-  Navigate to detailed job listings including **title**, **requirements**, **benefits**, and **descriptions**  
-  Use a fully simulated **application form** with fields for personal data and position selection  
-  Submit an application and receive visual confirmation in an intuitive UX flow

This project demonstrates practical skills in **Power BI interface design**, **data modeling**, and **user journey planning** in a business-like recruitment scenario.

### [Olist E-Commerce SQL Analysis](https://github.com/Mkrela11/Workspace/blob/main/Olist%20SQL%20Analsyis.sql)

An in-depth SQL analytics project based on the real-world **Brazilian e-commerce Olist dataset**, designed to showcase relational reasoning, data segmentation, and business insights extraction.

The project is structured into five thematic analytical segments:

- **Segment 1: Core KPIs** ‚Äì summary statistics on customers, sellers, orders, products, and reviews  
- **Segment 2: Orders & Payments** ‚Äì revenue calculations, shipping costs, and payment methods including installments  
- **Segment 3: Customer Segmentation** ‚Äì classification into VIP / Medium / Low spenders, with regional behavior insights  
- **Segment 4: Top Sellers & Products** ‚Äì most valuable products and sellers ranked by revenue, reach, and customer base  
- **Segment 5: Delivery Problems** ‚Äì late deliveries, average delays, and their correlation with customer review scores

This project demonstrates advanced SQL querying, use of window functions, temporary tables, segmentation logic, and preparation of outputs for BI tools such as Power BI or Tableau.

### [Olist Power BI Dashboard](https://github.com/Mkrela11/Workspace/blob/main/Olist%20Dashboard.pdf)

A comprehensive **Power BI report** built on top of the Olist Brazilian e-commerce dataset, designed to visually present business performance, customer behavior, and sales operations.

Due to the DB size it's only PDF. If you would like to view an PBIX - contact me. 

This dashboard was structured across multiple views and includes:

-  **Executive Overview** ‚Äì a clean one-page layout showcasing KPIs like revenue, delayed orders, average order value, and item count  
-  **Product & Seller Insights** ‚Äì top categories and sellers by value, along with detailed sales breakdowns  
-  **Payment Breakdown** ‚Äì income grouped by payment types with proportions and volumes  
-  **Customer Segmentation** ‚Äì revenue band classification based on purchase value and grouped order volume  

This project demonstrates advanced **Power BI interface design**, **data modeling**, **DAX usage**, and **data storytelling** using real-world e-commerce data.

### [HR Analytics Dashboard ‚Äì IBM Employees](https://github.com/Mkrela11/Workspace/blob/main/Hr_IBM.pbix)

This project was designed to explore HR metrics related to employee demographics, departmental breakdown, and education, supporting workforce planning and strategic HR insights.

### [HR IBM Data Analsyis in R](https://github.com/Mkrela11/Workspace/blob/main/Hr_IBM_R)

It's a follow up to the projected mentioned above.

Here I have focused more on variables messured within interval scales. I've used libraries like RandomForest, psych, pheatmap, factoextra, dplyr, ggplot2 and tidyr. 
Main idea behind this code was to take a deeper look into HR Data and analyze trends, outliers and use statistical methods to analyze results.

Code Provides:

- **Attrition Modeling (Random Forest)** ‚Äì prediction of employee churn based on variables like overtime, job satisfaction, or years at company  
- **Principal Component Analysis** ‚Äì dimensionality reduction and rotation (Varimax), capturing 75% of variance in 4 PCs  
- **Clustering** ‚Äì segmentation of employees into distinct behavioral profiles, visualized with cluster plots  
- **Job Satisfaction Regression** ‚Äì ordinal regression assessing influence of distance, overtime, and promotion history on satisfaction  
- **Income Outlier Detection** ‚Äì IQR-based detection of salary anomalies with boxplots, focus on top 5% earners  
- **Role Profiling for High Earners** ‚Äì breakdown of top-paid employees by department, job role, and attrition rate
